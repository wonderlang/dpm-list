This is the official Wonder package registry.

# Registering your Package
Make sure your Wonder package is in a Github repo with all of the necessary files. Then fork this repo. Add the name of your package and the repo URL (separated by a space) to file `registry`, then open up a PR with your changes. If all goes well, then your PR will be merged and you will have registered your package!
